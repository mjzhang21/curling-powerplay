	abstract     = {The popularity of curling, a target sport played on ice with rocks, has been steadily increasing. The number of World Curling Federation member countries has doubled in the last two decades. Shortly after taking part in the Olympics in 1998, curling became one of the most popular winter sports on TV. The reflections of the interest in the society have found a response in the world of science and an increase has been observed in the number of scientific studies on curling. However, despite the increase in studies, there is currently no comprehensive literature review that provides fundamental information about the sport of curling. The aim of this review is to provide general information about the sport of curling and its rules by filling the gap in the literature examining the scientific studies in this field. In this review the history, organization management, rules, strategy, ice properties, materials used and scientific research on the sport of curling are mentioned. While previous studies, particularly in the field of engineering, have explored aspects such as the structure of ice, sweeping techniques, and the movement of stones on ice, many mysteries still remain to be unrevealed.}

	abstract     = {Curling is one of the most popular sports of the Olympic Winter Games. As strategy is very important for curling, it is called “chess on the ice”. Given the exponential surge in sports-related data, the analysis of game performance has assumed paramount importance, as it provides a valuable avenue for improving overall athletic performance. The aim of this research was to examine the effect of some parameters on championship performance of elite level curling teams. The data used in this study were taken from the World Curling Federation Historical Results database. World Mens/Womens Curling Championships (2021 – 2022 – 2023) and European Mens/Womens Curling Championships results (2019 – 2021 – 2022) included in the study. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the extent to which the independent variables, namely Draw Shot Challenge distance, shot performance, stolen points for, stolen points against, hammer efficiency, force efficiency, and difference of generated and given points, explained team success. Statistical Package for Social Sciences 24.0 software used for statistical analyses. The results revealed an R-value of 0.902 and an adjusted R-squared value of 0.804. In the study investigating the factors influencing team success in World and European Curling Championships, it was concluded that the difference of points generated and given points, Draw Shot Challenge distance, and hammer use efficiency predicts championship success.}

With the modification of the FGZ rule it is expected that the games will be played more competitively. The aim of this research is to examine the changes in various parameters such as the points generated per game, number of blank ends, total ends played, big ends and the extra end situation after the revised FGZ rule. Within the scope of the study elite level international competitions (Olympic Games, World and European Curling Championships) played for 3 years before (844 games) and after (908 games) the FGZ rule in the womens and mens category were evaluated. The data was taken from the Historical Results section of the World Curling Federation web page. Independent Sample t test was run in JASP 0.15.0.0 statistical analysis program. The level of significance was taken as p &amp;lt;.05 for statistical analysis. In the study examining the differences between the four and five rock FGZ rules in some parameters in the sport of curling, it was concluded that there are fewer blank ends and more points are being generated in the games after the five rock FGZ rule modification. In terms of results obtained it can be stated that the curling becomes more excited for both the curlers and spectators after the FGZ modification.}

	ABSTRACT     = {Introduction: There has been growth in research in the sport of curling over the past few decades. The need for a scoping review is warranted. This study’s purpose was to identify and synthesize research evidence regarding quantitative variables for a series of components within the sport of curling. Methods: A scoping review of studies published and established within four databases was performed. One independent reviewer selected studies based on a systematic procedure following the Arksey and O’Malley4 framework. Inclusion criteria for studies were: 1) interventions that focused on the sport of curling; 2) quantitative in nature; 3) written in English; and 4) published within a peer-reviewed journal, a conference presentation, or a published thesis. Results: Searching identified 8467 articles and 94 met the inclusion criteria. Data were organized and synthesized based on the devised research variables from the sport of curling: The curl mechanism of the curling stone; the impact of sweeping on stone trajectory; curling delivery mechanics; wheelchair curling; technology analysis; strategy and tactics; psychological factors; injury occurrences; facility and arena infrastructure; and assessment of curling training and ability. The findings confirm the strong knowledge base that exists across game variables and unveil controversy between the underlying physics that produces curl, as well as the mechanisms of sweeping responsible for manipulating the stone trajectory. Conclusions: Knowledge derived from this review can assist researchers, coaches, and curlers in addressing the specific variables of the sport that influence stone trajectory and game results. Such awareness will expose gaps in the current understanding and foster new research endeavors to further the knowledge of the sport.}

In particular, we examine the choice between taking a single point or blanking an end in the latter stages of a curling game. There are benefits and drawbacks associated with each alternative. Taking a single point provides the team with an additional point but transfers the last-shot advantage to the opposition. Blanking an end foregoes an additional point but retains the last-shot advantage. Based on the observation of world-class competitions, North American curlers will always attempt to blank an end, while their European counterparts have been known to opt for the single point. We develop a decision tree to conceptualize the choices. Then, we use data from over 900 national championship curling games to empirically determine the expected values of each alternative. Our results indicate that blanking the end is the better alternative.},

In practical applications, these end-winning probabilities can be estimated econometrically and are shown to depend on which team holds the hammer as well as the offensive and defensive strengths of the respective teams. Using a maximum entropy argument, based on the idea of characteristic scoring patterns in curling, we predict that the points distribution of scoring ends should follow a constrained geometric distribution.We provide analytical results detailing when it is optimal to blank the end in preference to scoring one point and losing possession of the hammer. Statistical and simulation analysis of international curling matches is also performed.Our work adds to the theory and application of sports analytics, especially Markov models, and to the econometric and strategic analysis of curling matches.},

The Markovian win probabilities were derived from the observed scoring probabilities using recursive logic.These win probabilities allowed us to answer questions regarding optimal curling strategy. When presented with the choice to score 1 point or blanking an end, we conclude that teams holding the hammer should choose to blank the end in most situations. Looking at empirical results of conceded matches, we conclude that concession behavior is consistent with a psychological win probability threshold of 2.57\%. However, we also find that teams frequently concede when their win probability at time of concession is, in fact, much higher than this threshold. This is true particularly after the 9th end, suggesting that teams are conceding matches when they have up to a 15\% chance of winning.}

The objective of this paper is to apply sensitivity analysis as a methodology to differentiate what appears to be two seemingly equal scenarios. A probability tree is developed for each scenario and a comparison is made based on an expected value basis. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine whether preference changes with changes in the key parameters. Indeed, preference is impacted by changes in these parameters. In general there is no universally preferred scenario; under specific conditions a general preference can be established. Ultimately, preference for one scenario over the other is based on an individual's perception of the probability of scoring with last shot.}

	abstract     = {Curling is a winter sport played by over one million people in at least 33 countries. As with other sports, strategy and teamwork play an important role in winning a curling game. Various strategies, such as when you have (or don’t have) the last stone, can be applied based on the situations. In curling games, it is widely known that the team throwing the last stone in the opening end is likely to win. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the outcome of the game based on the possession of first stone or last stone per end. For the analysis, data was collected from statistics and results of the WCF (World Curling Federation). 628 games (309 men's games and 319 women's games) which ended exactly at the tenth end were used. Binary logistic regression in SPSS 20.0 was applied for the analysis. A dependent variable was the game outcome, and ten independent variables were the possessions of the last stone per end. As a result, it is found that there was a statistical significance (p< 0.05) between the game outcome and the possession of the last stone from the first end to the tenth end, except the second end. Specifically, the possession of the first or last stone in the ninth end was more closely related to winning the game than other ends.}
